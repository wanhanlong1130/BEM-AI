# AUTOMA-AI - Autonomous Multi-Agent Network

AUTOMA-AI is a dynamic multi-agent network system built on Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol) protocols, combining the power of LangChain, Google GenAI, and modern agent orchestration for engineering task orchestration.


## ⚠️ Project Status

This project is in its **early development phase** and is considered **highly unstable**. APIs, interfaces, and core functionality are subject to significant changes. Use for development and experimentation only.

## 🚀 Overview

AUTOMA-AI creates a distributed multi-agent system that enables intelligent agents to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate using industry-standard protocols. The system leverages:

- **Google A2A Protocol**: For agent-to-agent communication
- **Anthropic MCP Protocol**: For model context management
- **LangChain / LangGraph**: For LLM-based agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Google GenAI**: For AI model integration

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **LangChain / LangGraph**: Agent framework and orchestration
- **Google GenAI**: AI model integration
- **Google A2A**: Agent-to-agent communication protocol
- **Anthropic MCP**: Model context protocol implementation

### Development Tools
- **uv**: Modern Python package management
- **Python 3.12**: Runtime environment

## 🔧 Installation
We recommend install AUTOMA-AI through PYPI:
```shell
pip install automa-ai
```
This will install all packages needed under automa_ai folder.


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bem-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   uv shell
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests
TBD

## 🏗️ Architecture
<img src="sources/architecture.png" alt="System Architecture" width="600">

- **Orchestrator**: Assemble workflow, access agent card storage
- **Task Memory**: Task memory including shared blackboard and conversation history
- **Planner**: A planner agent
- **Summary**: A summary agent
- **Specialized agents**: Domain specific agents
- **Agent Card Service**: A RAG pipeline stores agent cards
- **Tool and Resources**: External tool and resource access through MCPs

## 📝 Configuration

Project configuration is managed through `pyproject.toml`. Key configuration areas include:

- **Dependencies**: Core and development packages
- **Build System**: uv-based build configuration
- **Project Metadata**: Version, description, and author information
- **Optional**: optional packages to use for UI integration and running examples.

### A2A Server Base Path

You can mount an A2A agent server under a URL prefix by passing `base_url_path` to
`A2AAgentServer`. This is useful when serving behind a reverse proxy or when you
want a dedicated path segment for the agent.

```python
from automa_ai.common.agent_registry import A2AAgentServer

chatbot_a2a = A2AAgentServer(chatbot, public_agent_card, base_url_path="/permit")
```

Notes:
- Include a trailing slash in client URLs to avoid 307 redirects (SSE does not
  follow redirects): e.g., 

```python 
SimpleClient(agent_url=f"{A2A_SERVER_URL}/permit/")
```

### Retriever configuration

Automa-AI retrieval uses a provider-based spec (by name or dotted import path). Registry names must
be registered with `register_retriever_provider(...)`, and only the embedding section is standardized;
`retrieval_provider_config` is passed through to the selected provider.

**Registered provider (registry name)**
```yaml
retriever:
  enabled: true
  provider: "helpdesk_chroma"
  top_k: 6
  embedding:
    provider: "ollama"
    model: "nomic-embed-text"
    api_key: null
    base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
    extra: {}
  retrieval_provider_config:
    db_path: "/data/chroma"
    collection_name: "my_collection"
```

**Custom provider (dotted import path)**
```yaml
retriever:
  enabled: true
  impl: "my_project.retrieval:MyRetrieverProvider"
  top_k: 10
  embedding:
    provider: "openai"
    model: "text-embedding-3-large"
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
    base_url: null
    extra:
      dimensions: 3072
  retrieval_provider_config:
    index_name: "prod-index"
    namespace: "tenant-a"
    pinecone_api_key: "${PINECONE_API_KEY}"
    pinecone_env: "us-west-2"
```

## Examples
#### Single Agent Chatbot with Streamlit UI interface
This example demonstrates the use of automa-ai for creating a live-streaming chatbot.
The example uses QWEN3:4B as the language model and a sample MCP server is built to connect with the agent, demonstrating the capabilities of streaming and tool calling using a single chat bot.
See [README](./examples/sim_chat_demo/README.md)

#### Simple BEM typical building Network
This example is the prototype of BEM-AI, which consists of multiple agents collaboratively completing a building energy modeling task together.
See [README](./examples/sim_bem_network/README.md)

### EnergyPlus Chatbot with EnergyPlus MCP server
This example shows automa-ai integrates with EnergyPlus MCP, developed by LBNL.
See [README](./examples/eplus_mcp_demo/README.md)
